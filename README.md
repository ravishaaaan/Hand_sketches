# Handsketch Recognition and Colorization

A web application to recognize and colorize hand-drawn sketches using a pretrained transformer model. Users can either upload an image or draw directly on a canvas, and the system will:

1. Convert the sketch to grayscale.

2. Predict the sketch category with confidence.

3. Apply automatic colorization based on the detected sketch.

Built with Streamlit, OpenCV, and Hugging Face Transformers, featuring an interactive interface with real-time drawing, prediction, and colorization.
